              I am a final-year B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student
              at Sanjay Ghodawat University with a strong passion for full-stack
              web development. Specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB,
              Express.js, React, Node.js), I have built several hands-on
              projects including an expense tracker, quiz application, hotel
              listing platform, and a weather forecasting app. These experiences
              have not only strengthened my technical skills but also honed my
              ability to design user-centric interfaces and integrate APIs
              effectively.
              <br />
              <br />
              In addition to development, I actively focus on mastering Data
              Structures and Algorithms, primarily using C++. I am following a
              structured roadmap covering basic to advanced topics like
              recursion, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming. I consistently
              participate in coding challenges and post my progress on LinkedIn
              to stay accountable and inspire others. My problem-solving mindset
              and foundational knowledge in C, C++, and Python enable me to
              approach challenges from multiple angles.
              <br />
              <br />
              I‚Äôm also exploring AI integration within web applications through
              a project called ‚ÄúRIA,‚Äù. My portfolio reflects a balance between
              technical depth and user-focused design, with certifications in
              React, Postman, and Python further validating my expertise. I
              thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments and am
              continuously learning to build impactful digital solutions that
              solve real-world problems.

              My vision is to become a well-rounded software engineer capable of
              building intelligent, scalable, and user-friendly web applications
              that make a real-world impact. I aim to contribute to open-source
              projects, collaborate with innovative teams, and eventually lead
              initiatives that blend AI with frontend development to create
              smarter user interfaces.
              <br />
              <br />
              I believe in continuous learning, and my roadmap includes diving
              deeper into system design, cloud architecture, and AI model
              integration. With every project, I strive not just to build but to
              innovate ensuring my work remains relevant and valuable in a
              rapidly evolving tech landscape.
              <br />
              <br />
              Ultimately, I want to use technology to empower individuals and
              communities by developing solutions that are both accessible and
              impactful.
